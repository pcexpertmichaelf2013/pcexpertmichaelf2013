## **Objective**  

I am seeking a full time position with a company that values a positive customer experience as much as I do. I've had the benefit of many hours of the highest tier training from Fortune 500 companies on how to provide an excellent experience for clients. I have full availability, weekends, holidays and overtime. I have reliable transportation and I am also setup and have experience working remotely. I am willing to relocate and travel for work. I am a US Citizen and proud New Mexican.
